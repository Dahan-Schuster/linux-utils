# Linux Terminal Functions
Bash functions to include into your Linux terminal's config file (.bashrc, .zshrc etc)

## Notes
By now, only Git functions were made. Feel free to write more useful shorthands and make a pull request!

If you have any issues using any function, check if there's already a function defined by another installed library

## Usage
The functions will be available to you at your terminal simple by typing its name.

Example:  ` ~$ gum `

## Installation
- Copy and paste the contents bellow into yours terminal's config file (It will probably be into the home directory (~/))
- Close the terminal and open it again
- That's it :)
